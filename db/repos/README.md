## Database Repositories

This folder contains one JavaScript file for each database repository, except for [transactions].

Each repository is currently a single ES6 class, with the class's name exported.

Name of each repository in the protocol is automatically made up by the name of the file that implements the repository.

[transactions]: ./transactions
